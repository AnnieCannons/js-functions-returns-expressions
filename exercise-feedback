// Exercise 1 looks great

// Exercise 2
// What is line 37 doing?
//   return console.log(`Welcome ${name}! We are glad you are here.`)
// What is the difference between a return and a console.log?

//ah ok I understand, its kind of redundant - return says to bring back the variable written after it and says to stop running any other code written before it

// Exercise 3
// Be sure to use a variable declaration keyword (like let or const) when creating a variable

// Exercise 4 looks good

// Exercise 5
// Take a look at the function you created.
// function first() {
// return arguments[0][0];
// }
// Does it take in parameters? Where is the arguments keyword coming from?
// How would you call this function with a different array of animals?
